        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm <strong>Rameshkannan</strong>, a passionate Computer Science student
          who loves solving problems and building real-world projects.
          My journey began with a deep curiosity about software systems, and today I specialize
          in modern web development, machine learning experiments, and system design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am consistently sharpening my skills through platforms like <strong>LeetCode</strong>,
          where I focus on problem-solving, algorithm optimization, and mastering data structures.
          I believe strong problem-solving skills are the backbone of great engineering.
